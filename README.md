### shære

---

`:shaere` allows your existing users "shære" Æ with each other without any additional software (for the end-user, that is).

All you need to do is implement a callback module for `:shaere` to bind your user ids with private keys for the Æternity blockchain.

---

Since this project is using Æternity's testnet, you can top the account that `:shaere` creates for you in https://faucet.aepps.com/ by pasting your address there. To learn your address in, for example, [@shaerebot](https://t.me/shaerebot), send the bot `/address` command in a private chat.

There are two example projects (see [/examples](https://github.com/spawnfest/shaere/tree/master/examples)) which illustrate this idea, be sure to check them out! I spent more time on them than on the actual library ...
