### OMG WHAT IS SHÆRE

---

It's a bad pun, and it's also a good little library that allows your existing users "shære" [Æ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeternity/) with each other without any additional software. No additional software for the end-user, that is. You'd still need to install and setup `:shaere`, but don't worry, it's real easy.

Just plonk `shaere` into your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    # ... deps ...
    # I usually order the deps by their usefullness
    # .. deps ....
    # .... deps ..
    {:shaere, github: "spawnfest/shaere"}
  ]
end
```

And implement a callback module for `:shaere` to bind your user ids with private keys on the Æternity blockchain:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ShaereStorage do
  @moduledoc """
  `:shaere` only needs to know how to associate your existing users' ids
  with private keys, so the only callback that it needs right now is `privkey/1`
  """
  
  @behaviour Shaere.StorageAdapterType
  
  # ...

  @impl Shaere.StorageAdapterType
  def privkey(user_id) do
    # it works best if the operation is "isolated"
    # to avoid creating multiple keys for the same user
    # like `BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;` in postgres
    # https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html#XACT-SERIALIZABLE
    # or a protected ets table or an sqlite db with a single writer (default)
    in_some_isolated_db_transaction(fn ->
      # get a private key from a database
      if privkey = Database.privkey(user_id: user_id) do
        privkey
      else
        # if it doesn't yet exist, you can use `Shaere.Ae.keypair()`
        # to generate an approprivate privkey
        %{secret: <<privkey::64-bytes>>} = Shaere.Ae.keypair()
        # don't forget to persist this privkey (but only if it doesn't yet exist)
        :ok = Database.save_new_privkey(privkey, user_id: user_id)
        # and then also don't forget to return it
        privkey
      end
    end)
  end
  
  # ...
end
```

Don't forget to let `:shaere` know about your storage module by using `Shaere.set_storage_adapter(module)`

```elixir
# somewhere in your app startup phase
:ok = Shaere.set_storage_adapter(MyApp.ShaereStorage)

# you can change it later at runtime if you need to 
# by calling the same command but with a different module
```

After that you can

```elixir
# get the address of a user on the blockchain
Shaere.address(user_id) # => "ak_uBXfaCX5uYVMaePtS2ybXv4nahu8ALfmGcsgge9ghrfAHD6Wf"

# get the balance of a user on the blockchain
Shaere.balance(user_id) # => 5000

# send tokens from one user to another
Shaere.shaere(sender_user_id, receiver_user_id, amount) # => {:ok, "th_2A9PibNnDbNDNJ78ZQxMdfXAPP8dZ1XnhiZpJBJSy4aefixtDr"}
```

#### Security

Secure it is not. You are (I am) storing private keys somewhere in a database, probably in plaintext!!1 Of course it's not secure. Of course! (Guess how cryptocurrency exchanges work)

But who cares? It's convinient.

"Just" tell your users to not store much on the accounts generated by `:shaere`,
just like [@shaerebot](https://t.me/shaerebot) suggest to treat these accounts like "pocket change"
when it responds to the `/balance` command.

There are some improvements possible though. (TODO this section might get outdated)

- allow having an additional address to where all funds (or some %) are redirected, the private key to which the user stores safely in a cold storage
- encrypt the private key with a passphrase, the user would need to supply it every time they interact with the private key, for example, when "shæring"
- maybe implement the current functionality with a smart contract and an oracle, if that's at all possible

---

#### Getting (fake) tokens

Since this project is using Æternity's testnet, you can top the account that `:shaere` creates for you in https://faucet.aepps.com/ by pasting your address there.

To learn your address in, for example, [@shaerebot](https://t.me/shaerebot) (which is one of the example procjets, see the next section), send the bot `/address` command in a private chat.

---

#### Examples

There are two example projects (see [/examples](https://github.com/spawnfest/shaere/tree/master/examples)) which illustrate this idea, be sure to check them out! Please ...

I spent more time on them than on the actual library ...

---

#### I see a makefile

Yep. It can `make setup` and `make check`.
