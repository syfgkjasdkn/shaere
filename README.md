### shære

---

`:shaere` allows your existing users "shære" Æ with each other without any additional software (for the end-user, that is).

All you need to do is implement a callback module for `:shaere` to bind your user ids with private keys for the Æternity blockchain.

There are two example projects which illustrate this idea, [a telegram bot called @shaerebot](https://t.me/shaerebot) and a website.

The way [@shaerebot](https://t.me/shaerebot) works is, it creates an account for each telegram user that interacts with it, either via a public room where users can `/shaere` æternity by replying to each other's messages or in a private room with the bot, where it's possible to ask the bot about your private key, your address, and your balance.
